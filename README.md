# HackerRank Linux Shell Solutions

This repository contains my ongoing solutions to HackerRank’s **Linux Shell** challenges.  
All scripts are written in **Bash** and reflect my continuous effort to strengthen command-line proficiency, problem-solving skills, and scripting fundamentals.

## 📌 Overview

The repository includes solutions for topics such as:

- Text processing (cut, paste, sort, tr, uniq)
- Search and filter operations (grep, sed, awk)
- Loops and conditionals in Bash
